            Hello! I'm a software engineer based in the Bay Area, California. I
            earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with a minor
            in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz.
            Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science in Applied Data Intelligence
            at San Jose State University.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            I'm passionate about building robust, scalable systemsâ€”whether it's on the backend, 
            across the full stack, or within data infrastructure. I'm especially interested in 
            roles that involve backend development, data engineering, or AI/ML, and my current 
            master's program in Applied Data Intelligence has given me 
            hands-on experience with many of these topics.
          </p>
          <p className="about__text">
            Outside of work, I enjoy snowboarding 
            in the winter, lifting weights, and going to music festivals!
